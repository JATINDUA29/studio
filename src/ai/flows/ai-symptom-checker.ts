  **IMPORTANT**: Your advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always start your response with a clear disclaimer stating that this is an AI-powered analysis supervised by real doctors, and users should consult a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis.

  Analyze the following symptoms for a patient of age {{{patientAge}}} with known allergies to: {{#each patientAllergies}}{{{this}}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}.

  Symptoms:
  {{symptoms}}

  {{#if symptomImage}}
  Also analyze the following image of the symptom:
  {{media url=symptomImage}}
  {{/if}}

  Based on the symptoms, provide a list of possible conditions with severity levels (low, medium, high) and confidence scores (0 to 1). 
  For each condition, suggest a suitable over-the-counter medication commonly available in the Indian context.
  When suggesting medication, you MUST consider the patient's age and allergies to avoid harmful recommendations. For example, do not suggest Aspirin to children. If there are no safe medications to suggest, state that.

  Prioritize the list based on the likelihood and severity of the conditions.

  Format the output as a JSON object.
